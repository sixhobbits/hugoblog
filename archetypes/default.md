**Note**: *This post is part of my [Publish Daily]() goal. These posts are not edited and I often battle to write exactly what I mean the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice. If I don't publish the snippets, I don't spend as much time worrying about the quality, so the main reason for publishing is to force myself to care. I also hope that they may be interesting to at least one person out there though.*
