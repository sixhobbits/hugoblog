Most days that you live through, you do some kind of *risk calculations*. We're seldom certain about anything, so we learn to estimate probabilities based on a wide range of knowledge and experiences, and hope for the best.

Most of us humans get pretty good at this, and we use this risk calculation skill to stay alive, pursue happiness, make money, and help other people. 

We also have a bunch of annoying biases though, and these biases often lead us to make the wrong choices. 

Most of these calculations boil down at some level to the value of something we think we can gain, the value of something we think we might lose, and the probabilistic frequency of a decision turning out good or bad (how likely is it that something will go wrong, and how often would this happen). 

Three interesting biases are:

* **Loss aversion**: we think that we dislike losing things more than we actually do. People will usually spend or do more to avoid losing something that they have than they would spend or do to gain that thing. 
* **Inertia**: we generally prefer to *not* do anything that changes the status quo too much, and specifically we prefer *not* to make decisions if we think we can avoid them.
* **Frequency vs magnitude**: We're generally bad at calculating the total value of a series of small decisions.

*Loss aversion* is why people generally end up with more stuff than they want, and why self-storage is an $x$-trillion-dullar business. For physical stuff, it's easy enough to compensate: just "lose" the thing you think you value for a few months and see how often you you needed it. For things like relationships, homes, jobs, it still exists but is harder to "test". 

One way to learn to compensate for *inertia* is to play speed chess. It pretty soon becomes obvious that one of the simplest winning strategies is to make decisions faster than your opponent and win on time. In chess, it's very clear that making no decision is always the worst decision. In life, it can be a bit less clear-cut, but decisions which look like you can ignore when you actually can't (ignoring them becomes an active decision on its own), become clearer when you think about "doing nothing" as watching your clock tick down towards certain loss.

Taleb talks a lot about frequency loss in "Fooled by Randomness" (the only book of his that I would recommend). Most people would prefer to lose R365/year in a once-off unexpected event than to steadily lose R1/day in expected events (at least in slightly more complicated cases where the overall value isn't instantly obvious). This is related to loss-aversion, but specifically for small, very frequent losses. We make lots of slightly risky decisions every day, where "losing" doesn't actually mean that much, and most people are more loss-averse in these cases than accounted for just by "normal" loss-aversion on its own. For small, frequent events, compensate harder by choosing the unsafe option more often, especially when the losses are limited and the choice comes up frequently.
