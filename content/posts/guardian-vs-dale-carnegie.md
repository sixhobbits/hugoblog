The Guardian released a new donation campaign ages ago. The messages at the bottom of each article always look something like this.

(their highlight).

If you've read any Dale Carnegie or other pop-psychology of a "self help" kind of nature, the first advice you usually hear about getting other people to do things for you. These people will tell you to make sure you focus not on *yourself* but on the other person. Don't tell your boss that you want a raise because you need to feed you children; tell him you want a raise because you're adding extra value to his bottom line. 

The Guardian's messaging seems backwards. They open by talking about falling advertising revenues. That's unlikely to be a problem the reader can relate to, nevermind one that the reader has.  The Guardian "needs" your donations to stay open. In the next paragraph, they hint that open reporting has some benefit to the reader, but they avoid explicitly saying it. They ask you to make a donation, and focus on how easy it is. 

Nowhere do they try to talk up the benefit of donating. They don't claim to help you solve your problems. They don't tell you that it's your last chance to ensure that you have independent journalism tomorrow. They don't tell you that your life is better with independent journalism.

Just a straightforward, slightly whiney, "we need money, please give it to us". 

Apparently it worked. I can't find a link now, but I read a review on their strategy about a year after they started it where (IIRC) they claimed that the campaign had been far more successful than they had expected. Readers were moved by the message and donated generously.

Could this be *because* the advice from *How to Win Friends and Influence People* is now so common place that people are tired of it? Perhaps readers are so used to business framing things as they think readers want to hear them, that this is something fresh and different? 

They're still in business, but apparently [also cutting jobs and losing money](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/the-guardian-goes-tabloid-cuts-300-jobs-is-donor-driven-business-model-sustainab/307179), so I guess we'll have to wait and see how good the strategy is on a longer term.

It's good to keep in mind that while flying in the face of conventional wisdom is often a good strategy, if it's successful enough, it also becomes conventional wisdom itself. Similarly, many businesses become successful by being brave enough to try new things, but when they become large and successful, they are not longer flexible enough to try new things, and end up getting stuck. [The Innovator's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) covers this in a lot more detail and is definitely worth a read, even if you're not that interested in the Disk Drive industry from a couple of decades ago.
