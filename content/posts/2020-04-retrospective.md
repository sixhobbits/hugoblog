I did a [2020 Q1 retrospective](https://sixhobbits.github.io/hugoblog/posts/2020-q1-retrospective/) pretty late, so this is more focused on the 10-30 April period.

## Ritza progress

Ritza is still evolving at what feels like a slow pace. I launched [ritza.co](ritza.co) today (actually it has been live for a while, but it had a brain dump on the homepage which I rewrote today to have more structure and provide more relevant information). I shared it on ZATech, HackerNews, and the EUTech telegram group and got some good feedback (thank you if you were one of the people that provided this!), which I am integrating into the next iteration.

I am still in some contact with two "startup facilitators" -- organizations in the Netherlands which can endorse startups which I need for my visa. Unfortunately both are very slow to respond to my emails, so I keep assuming that they are no longer interested, only to get a reply once I have given up.

Other miscelaneous bits of progress include:

* Trying to sign up for MailChimp again but realising I had already used the single "audience" for a test page I launched (startyourown.co) and then abandoned, so signing up for ConvertKit instead. Both are companies firmly in the marketing world that I consider at least slightly email (tracking, targeted advertising etc), but I do not want to sink the time needed into building my own mailing list system at this stag.
* Having the deck I mentioned in the previous post designed on fiverr - I wasn't super excited about the result but it's not terrible either and was good enough for what I needed it for. You can see it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uFljO1odpS9oyaTHY0uA4wO63WX_r_H6buEulXJzYPY/)
* Telling various people about Ritza and getting feedback. I did a mini-pitch and discussion for Ritza to two informal meetup groups, both through ZATech, and got some positive feedback on the concept (yay!) and some advice.
* I started a "Zettelkasten" system based on the advice of [CP Botha](https://cpbotha.net/). I'm still trying to figure out exactly to best use it and I am currently maintaining both a physical version with pen and paper and a digital version (I think the double entry actually helps instil the notes mentally too, but I only have 12 or so thus far so we'll see).

## Revenue

In the previous post, I mentioned I was on track to make $6000 in revenue for April. I ended up invoicing $5600 in revenue in the end after having to end a relationship with one client.

I had already agreed to something significantly below my usual rate for a trial article to "build the relationship" and had a good call with the CEO of the company to discuss the goals for the piece. Things seemed fairly promising until I submitted a 100 word or so outline as requested (basically just headings and a short description of what would be in each) and got dozens of nitpicky comments in response -- their editor spent over 2 hours (based on the Google docs comments timestamps) making comments about style, capitalization, American spelling conventions, etc etc. Maybe she was just very thorough but I took it badly and it felt like the comments were coming from an egotistical place rather than a supportive one, so I decided that it wasn't worth the time or emotional energy.

## What got published

* I spent many hours on editing a Python data science tutorial which had some pretty obscure and frustrating bugs and took way longer to fix than I had estimated.
* I also wrote [Machine learning for managers](https://datarevenue.com/en-blog/machine-learning-for-managers), which again hit rank #1 on Google after 48 hours for the search term `Machine Learning for Managers` and is now hovering between #1 and #3 for me.
* I compiled my first [showcase](https://ritza.co/showcase/repl.it). This involved downloading the original sources, cleaning up some of the markdown, finding a pandoc workflow that works for me (at the moment it's markdown -> `.adoc` (asciidoctor) using pandoc and then .adoc -> html using asciidoctor and the Ruby CSS stylesheet with highlight.js and the Monokai theme (which seems to be the only one that highlights a decent number of Python keywords). Once I have a publication pipeline better put together I'll publish a separate article on that. I also am editing the collection into a book format (currently downloadable as an ebook from the showcase page, but I'm adding an introduction, removing external links, and linking the chapters together more cohesively still).

## Where next?

I'm still trying to get the legal and tax side of everything set up. Progress is frustratingly slow. I also have a todo list which currently contains things such as:

* Collecting the rest of my content from around the web to combine it into more "showcases"
* Extending the homepage and additional pages to answer more questions people have (what kind of content do you produce?, why is it so expensive?, is this marketing?, why should I buy this? are some at the moment)
* Adding an "/open" dashboard (I was going to link to the popular Baremetrics page here but then I discovered that they link to "Hubstaff" which provides malware to allow employers to spy on their employees so I won't)

I don't expect things to change too much in the next 4 weeks while I am still spending a majority of my time at my full time job, but I hope to set more ambitious monthly goals from 1 June!
