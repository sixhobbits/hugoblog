## 2021

Machine Learning and AI will fall out of the public eye, but continue to be used extensively in products like self-driving cars and natural language processing. People will regard these as normal and care less about what what "AI" actually means. Research will be done once again mainly in statistics departments   rather than in *Data Science* departments. The term "Data Science" will fall out of the general public's day-to-day usage, but will continue to be referred to similarly to how "big data" and "internet of things" are talked about today.
