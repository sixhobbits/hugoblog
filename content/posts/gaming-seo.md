There is no shortage of people, agencies, books, and videos out there that will teach you how to game Google's algorithms and get your content onto page one. You'll learn how to "rank for specific keywords", "optimise your content strategy", "increase your domain authority", and "get 5000% returns, GUARANTEED from this AMAZING course FREE FOR TODAY ONLY!!!".

Search Engine Optimisation or SEO isn't all bullshit, but the ratio of bullshit to reasonable ideas is around 9:1 in my experience. And the 10% of content that is authentically attempting to help people through education is largely common sense - write content that people want to read, make sure your page loads fast and all devices, use sane page structures that Google can easily understand.

A strategy that works remarkable well but which most people won't tell you about, because it's difficult to charge money for, is to leave search engine optimization to search engines. 

Google spends unthinkable amounts of money in trying to make their main product — Google search — as useful as possible. They are attempting to optimize their search engine to show people relevant content. And they're pretty good at it. Trying to optimize your content for search engines is certainly possible, but it's an ever-changing game which takes a lot of time, effort, and money. 

If you have a choice between spending $10k of your hard-earned and 100 hours of your increasingly rare time on drawing visitors to your website, you have to divide it among the following areas:

1. Writing content that people want to read or finding and paying good content writers who write content that people want to read
2. "Strategizing" and "Brainstorming" about topic ideas
3. Buying SEO software 
4. Paying SEO specialists to do any of the above
5. Paying software developers to optimize the speed of your site through caching, CDNs, deferred JavaScript and any other number of tricks
6. Buying training courses and books for yourself and your team 
7. Doing ritualistic animal sacrifices to the SEO Gods
8. Etc

All of them are likely to help in some way, and you can combine in anyway that you think will work for you,  but focussing only on *1.* has a few advantages. 

**Advantage one**: It's not complicated. Write content that *educates* your potential customers for free, and they'll love it. You don't have to worry about which SEO methods really work and which are snake oil. You don't have to ask if the software is really worth that insane monthly price tag. You don't have to wonder if that Expert is really Expert or if he is in fact a Non-Expert-Pretending-To-Be-An-Expert. 

**Advantage two**: You leave SEO to Google, who are definitely fairly good at it. They'll make sure that changes to their algorithms still return content like yours, instead of vice versa.  

**Advantage three:** You'll be making the internet, and therefore the world, a better place by creating content that people want to read instead of creating yet another clickbait piece that somehow generates a small amount of money for you for a short time and a huge amount of money for Google when combined with all the other similar content. 

Sometimes the easy way out is the best. Write good content that helps solve real problems that people have and Google will help people find it.
