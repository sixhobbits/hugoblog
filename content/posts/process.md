Process is designed to make systems more efficient, but it often slows them down. The real purpose of process is to make systems, and especially employees, more _fungible_. 

If you are lucky enough to work with a small group of intelligent people, dedicated to a single cause, process is probably hurting them more than helping them. You should remove it. Nearly all.
