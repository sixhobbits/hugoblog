People like hype. Hype is hard to identify when it's happening, and is easy to identify with hindsight. Hype can last for different amounts of time - anything from minutes to decades. 

Hype in the world of technology is bad. A recurring theme is people getting very excited about some new technology and spending thousands of hours learning about it, building programmes or even whole schools around it, and over-saturating the market without producing much value. 

The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) has become something of a meme, and is fairly useful to talking about how hyped any new technology is. But like most business charts, it's hugely over-simplified. Manager-types love reducing any problem to a single graph and trying to sound smart by claiming to have solved it. 

Cryptocurrency was and is an obvious hype. There is some value in the invention, but a majority of people were not using it for anything that made it a better solution than previous technology. "Big data" continues to be relevant, but also did not live up to the hype from around 2014. 

Deep learning, Machine learning, AI, Data Science are reaching peak hype. 

A good way to identify hype is to divide things into *problems* and *solutions*. When people are focussing more on solutions than problems, it's likely that the solution is hyped.

For example, companies setting up "deep learning" teams or "big data" teams organises people around implementing a solution instead of solving problems. They get the latest and greatest algorithms and some highly paid people, and *then* ask "what can technology $x$ do for us"? 

Sometimes, hype can also be identified by seeing new terminology be invented for old solutions. For example, we've always had data analysts and statisticians. These people were widely regarded as stereotypically boring, along with accountants (any readers excluded of course). Now a lot of what these people do has been rebranded as "data science" or "AI". AI had a very specific meaning until recently. It was a branch of computer science concerned with path finding algorithms and optimisation problems. Now that we spread the term around liberally, in nearly any case where a computer is being used to solve a problem, terminology has gotten a lot less precise. 

Meanwhile, the Powers That Be have decided that "Data Scientist" is the sexiest job of the year. We've come a long way since Chandler Bing from *Friends* was given a data analyst job as an example of the pinnacle of boring. 

It's hard sometimes not to get caught up in the hype. Sometimes it's real. Some "AI" really did change the world, and some of it continues to do so. Big data has also changed how surveillance and marketing work, but most people don't like talking about that as much now as when people claimed that it would cure cancer.

It's good to keep up with the hype and stay informed, but to spend a majority of your time learning about old knowledge rather. Because of the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) it's far more likely that something that has been relevant for the last 50 years will remain relevant for the next 50 years than something that was only invented yesterday.
