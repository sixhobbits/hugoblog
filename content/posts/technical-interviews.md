Many programmers don't like the style of technical interviews given by most companies. In these "whiteboarding" interviews, you are usually given a difficult problem from computer science in which you have to produce a program that can take some input and efficiently produce some related output. Usually, to pass these interviews, you need to have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, including graph traversal algorithms, tree data structures (maybe even the dreaded red-black tree, which is known for being very complicated and hard to understand intuitively),  and dynamic programming. 

People don't like them because although these topics are usually taught at university computer science courses, very few people use any of that knowledge day-to-day. All of these "classic" problems have libraries that are far more efficient than the simplified algorithms taught in theory classes, and to do well at these questions, you usually need to memorise a whole bunch of "useless" knowledge (knowledge that you don't need outside of a context where you are being evaluated). 

There are some reason why technical interviewing hasn't changed much in spite of the problems that people raise though. 

####  Most companies prefer false negatives to false positives

An interview tries to classify candidates into "hire" or "don't hire". It's usually better for companies to have a good candidate go into the "don't hire" pool than vice-versa. It's far more costly to hire a "bad egg", who can take a long time to get rid of, and cause damage, than it is to miss a "good egg" (there will always be more good eggs in the queue). There are a lot of "good eggs" who do badly at programming interviews -- they have more practical experience than theoretical experience, and they dislike memorising useless knowledge, but Google is happy to lose out on these. It's far less common for someone to be able to write out a left-rotation for a red-black tree on a white board who is then incompetent in other areas. So white boarding isn't directly testing the skills that companies actually want, but given their preferences of not hiring bad eggs, it's a decent proxy.

#### Companies value predictability and loyalty

People who do well at whiteboarding are often similar in other ways too. They are good problem solvers (you can't memorise every possible interview question, so while memorisation helps, you still need to be able to apply the concepts you memorised in slightly novel ways), and they're pretty dedicated. They took the time and effort to get good at something that they knew they needed to be good at if they wanted to get hired. It's not uncommon to study for 3-6 months to get past a technical interview at one of the large tech companies, and there's enough information out here about what each company focuses on. If a candidate has taken the time and effort to work out how to do well at the interview, they probably really want to work for that specific company, which is a "green flag" for interviewers -- they didn't just apply for the job as an afterthought one day. They really want it, and they'll probably stick around. 

#### There aren't that many great alternatives

To really test someone, you need longer than a day to get to know them. The best interview would be bringing them into your existing team and to evaluate them over several weeks or months. It's not unusual for startups to do this -- they often employ someone on a fixed-term short contract first and then convert them to full time employees after they've proven themselves, but this is highly impractical for a majority of applicants, who might have full time jobs somewhere else, or need to relocate across the world to join the company that gives them a job.

I'm interviewing later today to be a part time technical interviewer for [karat.io](karat.io) (it's a bit meta). They claim to solve some of these problems, but even after several years of academic computer science and several years of industry experience, I'm only about 40% sure that I can pass their technical interview.
