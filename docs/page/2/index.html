            Sometimes, aiming at a goal is the best way to ensure that you hit that goal. At other times, the relationship is more subtle (for example, what you think might be goal, could actualy be a measurement).
In many cases, aiming at the goal, or at least what seems to be the goal, is surest way to miss the goal. Take, for example, the fairly modern fad of &ldquo;networking&rdquo;. The basic idea is that &ldquo;networks&rdquo; are valuable &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know exactly which of your connections will help you in what way or at what time, but it is very common for somone that you know to provide you with value.

            Many people have problems without solution. This can be frustrating for those people.
It&rsquo;s more and more common for people to have solutions without problems, which can also be frustrating for those people, and for those around them.
Especially in over-hyped spaces, such as big data, blockchain, deep learning, data science, and the internet of things, people look for problems that they can solve. This is almost always misguided.
People who want to &ldquo;do data science&rdquo; usually don&rsquo;t.

            When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
&gt; Charles Goodhart
 Measuring stuff is generally useful. Data, in general, is useful too. If you&rsquo;re trying to run a big complicated business, it&rsquo;s definitely a good idea to look at data, see what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and make decisions accordingly.
But.
Measurements should never be goals. Ever. Maybe the number of lines of code your programmers are writing is in some way linked to their value as a programmer, but paying or promoting them based on LoC is an obviously terrible idea.

            There is no shortage of people, agencies, books, and videos out there that will teach you how to game Google&rsquo;s algorithms and get your content onto page one.

Search Engine Optimisation or SEO isn&rsquo;t all bullshit, but the ratio of bullshit to reasonable ideas is around 9:1 in my experience.

To (probably) misquote Douglas Adams:
 Asking people about their opinions is a great way of making friends. Telling people about your opinions can also work, but normally not quite as well.
 And he definitely wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Similar to opinions, asking people for advice is a good way of making friends too. Giving people unrequested advice is a good way to annoy them.

            This is a (late) 2018 retrospective. It&rsquo;s mainly for personal use as I enjoy looking back and seeing how naive I was $n$ years ago, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading retrospectives from others in the tech community so I&rsquo;m making it public without advertising it too widely.
The year of employment I took up full time employment at CoGrammar (formerly HyperionDev, a product we still run) in November 2017. As I&rsquo;m still here, 2018 marks my first year ever of uninterrupted full time employment (I previously did two relatively long periods at AWS, but these were interleved between academic commitments).

            Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that many people partially rely on. It&rsquo;s the simplest form of ethics: if you want to know if some action is moral or not, just have a look at the result of that action, and then decide.
Should you give food to a starving person? Sure, it will result in the starving person not being hungry, which is a moral result, so therefore the charity is a moral action.

            Incentives seem very well understood. We have a whole bunch of natural sounding ideas, such as
 If you reward a person for a specific behaviour, you&rsquo;ll encourage more of that behaviour. If you punish someone for a specific behaviour, you&rsquo;ll encourage less of that behaviour. If you need someone to do something that they don&rsquo;t want to do, you need to monitor them to make sure that they actually do it.

            Salaries After the big #TalkPay movement a couple of years ago, and the related discussion that came up as a result, I thought people were more aware of the imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to salary negotiation. But I still see a lot of people who are very happy to answer this question straight up. You shouldn&rsquo;t. Never name the first number in a salary negotiation, and never give up any information about your previous salaries either.

            People are afraid of boredom. They actively avoid having any time that is unscheduled. If they do find a brief moment of unscheduled time, they quickly focus on finding something to do (reading Twitter in the checkout queue).
Boredom isn&rsquo;t really a negative emotion. It&rsquo;s not like fear or dread or hate or pain. And even busy-bodies like it for brief moments, as long as you call it &ldquo;relaxation&rdquo;.
You get home from whatever chaotic thing seemed important at the time, and just do nothing for a while.
