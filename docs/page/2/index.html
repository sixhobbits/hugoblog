    <h2 class="post-title">Boredom</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">People are afraid of boredom. They actively avoid having any time that is unscheduled. If they do find a brief moment of unscheduled time, they quickly focus on finding something to do (reading Twitter in the checkout queue).
Boredom isn’t really a negative emotion. It’s not like fear or dread or hate or pain. And even busy-bodies like it for brief moments, as long as you call it “relaxation”.
You get home from whatever chaotic thing seemed important at the time, and just do nothing for a while....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">The Guardian released a new donation campaign ages ago. The messages at the bottom of each article always look something like this.
(their highlight).
If you’ve read any Dale Carnegie or other pop-psychology of a “self help” kind of nature, the first advice you usually hear about getting other people to do things for you. These people will tell you to make sure you focus not on yourself but on the other person....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Technical Interviews</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Many programmers don’t like the style of technical interviews given by most companies. In these “whiteboarding” interviews, you are usually given a difficult problem from computer science in which you have to produce a program that can take some input and efficiently produce some related output. Usually, to pass these interviews, you need to have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, including graph traversal algorithms, tree data structures (maybe even the dreaded red-black tree, which is known for being very complicated and hard to understand intuitively), and dynamic programming....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">People like hype. Hype is hard to identify when it’s happening, and is easy to identify with hindsight. Hype can last for different amounts of time - anything from minutes to decades.
Hype in the world of technology is bad. A recurring theme is people getting very excited about some new technology and spending thousands of hours learning about it, building programmes or even whole schools around it, and over-saturating the market without producing much value....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Risk Calculation and Human Biases</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Most days that you live through, you do some kind of risk calculations. We’re seldom certain about anything, so we learn to estimate probabilities based on a wide range of knowledge and experiences, and hope for the best.
Most of us humans get pretty good at this, and we use this risk calculation skill to stay alive, pursue happiness, make money, and help other people.
We also have a bunch of annoying biases though, and these biases often lead us to make the wrong choices....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Enjoyment vs Satisfaction</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The English language is not known for being precise. People use the same words to mean very different things, often inconsistently. This confused language leads to confused thoughts, which leads people to make bad decisions.
One example of this is are two different pleasurable feelings, which I’ll call enjoyment and satisfaction, although most people use these fairly interchangeably. For now, let’s assume that enjoyment is a short-lived shallower emotion, while satisfaction lasts longer and is overall more desirable (another word with an imprecise meaning)....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">“All models are wrong, but some are useful”, someone smart once said.
A common mistake people make is to have mental models in too few dimensions. This is understandable because thinking in multiple dimensions is a known human weakness. If you want to visualise something in 17 dimensional space, you have to visualise it in 3 dimensional space and say “17” to yourself repeatedly.
But I digress. Take introverts for example....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">You might know that I’m pretty critical of companies, jobs, bosses, etc. A good intro to some of these ideas is Paul Graham’s Essay on why we weren’t meant to have a “boss”. Children get introduced to the idea that someone else should tell you what to do and when to do it at a young age, but it is far from a natural or healthy way to live....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">People will tell you to fake it until you make it. You might find that slightly disturbing. Doesn’t the world have enough lying, over-confident people in it already? You’ve probably met that guy (let’s call him Guy) who says he can do everything, but can’t. Maybe people think he’s smart, but actually it’s all just a veneer of confidence, and as he walks through life causing trouble and producing bad quality output, he continues to cover everything in his oily confidence, and people continue to regard him as competent....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I didn’t make any resolutions for 2019, but I would like this year to be one of building constructive habits. I skimmed some concepts in 2018 around the power of habit, and spent some time with ideas like ‘Do we spend too much time focusing on things topics like Inspiration when most of what we achieve is actually driven by self discipline and habit’.
I fell in and out of several good and bad habits during 2018, including a reading habit where I read a bunch of books, a note-taking habit where I took copious notes about each of these books, and a writing habit, where I worked each morning for an hour on writing technical tutorials, emails, or other ideas....</p>
