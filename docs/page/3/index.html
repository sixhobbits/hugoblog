    <h2 class="post-title">Embracing the Paradox</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">“All models are wrong, but some are useful”, someone smart once said.
A common mistake people make is to have mental models in too few dimensions. This is understandable because thinking in multiple dimensions is a known human weakness. If you want to visualise something in 17 dimensional space, you have to visualise it in 3 dimensional space and say “17” to yourself repeatedly.
But I digress. Take introverts for example....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The Problem With Going Independent</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">You might know that I’m pretty critical of companies, jobs, bosses, etc. A good intro to some of these ideas is Paul Graham’s Essay on why we weren’t meant to have a “boss”. Children get introduced to the idea that someone else should tell you what to do and when to do it at a young age, but it is far from a natural or healthy way to live....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">The Ethics of Fake It Till You Make It</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">People will tell you to fake it until you make it. You might find that slightly disturbing. Doesn’t the world have enough lying, over-confident people in it already? You’ve probably met that guy (let’s call him Guy) who says he can do everything, but can’t. Maybe people think he’s smart, but actually it’s all just a veneer of confidence, and as he walks through life causing trouble and producing bad quality output, he continues to cover everything in his oily confidence, and people continue to regard him as competent....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I didn’t make any resolutions for 2019, but I would like this year to be one of building constructive habits. I skimmed some concepts in 2018 around the power of habit, and spent some time with ideas like ‘Do we spend too much time focusing on things topics like Inspiration when most of what we achieve is actually driven by self discipline and habit’.
I fell in and out of several good and bad habits during 2018, including a reading habit where I read a bunch of books, a note-taking habit where I took copious notes about each of these books, and a writing habit, where I worked each morning for an hour on writing technical tutorials, emails, or other ideas....</p>
