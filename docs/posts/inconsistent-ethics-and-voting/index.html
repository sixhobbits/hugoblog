  <div class="post-content"><p>Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that many people partially rely on. It&rsquo;s the simplest form of ethics: if you want to know if some action is moral or not, just have a look at the <em>result</em> of that action, and then decide.</p>

<p>Should you give food to a starving person? Sure, it will result in the starving person not being hungry, which is a moral result, so therefore the charity is a moral action.</p>

<p>Should you order a milkshake at a restaurant without asking them to <a href="https://www.change.org/p/starbucks-replace-plastic-straws-with-biodegradable-paper-straws">hold the straw</a>? No, because the straw might end up in an innocent turtle&rsquo;s nose, which is an immoral result.</p>

<p>Other people may claim to follow virtue ethics, in which things are a bit more complicated. Or deontological ethics, which could make it harder still. Let&rsquo;s ignore them for now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people who vote in western democracies to assume a moral high ground over people who don&rsquo;t vote. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t vote, you can&rsquo;t complain&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;You as an individual have power&rdquo;, they say. &ldquo;Voting is a privilege&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Imagine if everyone didn&rsquo;t vote&rdquo;, they say.</p>

<p>They might be right, but they are also often logically inconsistent. All of the phrases above are false or irrelevant to the question of whether or not one has a moral obligation to vote. Even very rational people tend to get highly emotional about the topic of non-voters.</p>

<p>A couple of fairly non-controversial facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results">few</a> elections are decided by a single vote.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you probably don&rsquo;t have influence over thousands of people (say <a href="https://twitter.com/sixhobbits">hi</a> if you do).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, unless you enjoy playing the lottery, or you&rsquo;re very actively involved in politics, the <em>outcome</em> of you choosing to vote is the same as the <em>outcome</em> of you choosing not to vote. The actual process of voting is generally something that people find unpleasant (standing in queues and filling out forms). So just like playing the lottery, voting is something that you might be advised to avoid (it&rsquo;s only a small inconvenience/expense, but at the odds of it producing a favourable outcome, or having any influence at all, being so small, there&rsquo;s an overall expected negative payoff).</p>

<p>Therefore, if you vote and broadly follow utilitarianism then, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t assume a moral highground over non-voters. If you do want to assume this highground, you should be prepared to defend virtue ethics or deontology over utilitarianism and have some backing for your ideas that voting is an inherently moral action, or an action that inherently good people take part in.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re running a country and want people to participate in a form of democracy, you should probably make it illegal to not vote (as in Australia), or be prepared for a slowly dwindling number of active voters.</p>
