<h1 id="april-2020-retrospective">April 2020 Retrospective</h1>

<p>I did a <a href="https://sixhobbits.github.io/hugoblog/posts/2020-q1-retrospective/">2020 Q1 retrospective</a> pretty late, so this is more focused on the 10-30 April period.</p>

<h2 id="ritza-progress">Ritza progress</h2>

<p>Ritza is still evolving at what feels like a slow pace. I launched <a href="ritza.co">ritza.co</a> today (actually it has been live for a while, but it had a brain dump on the homepage which I rewrote today to have more structure and provide more relevant information). I shared it on ZATech, HackerNews, and the EUTech telegram group and got some good feedback (thank you if you were one of the people that provided this!), which I am integrating into the next iteration.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t set proper goals for May, but I have a to do list which includes improving the showcase, adding more &ldquo;meta articles&rdquo;, i.e. articles produced under the Ritza model but for Ritza itself instead of a client, and hiring a writing assistant.</p>

<p>I am also still in some contact with two &ldquo;startup facilitators&rdquo; &ndash; organizations in the Netherlands which can endorse startups which I need for my visa.</p>

<p>Other miscelaneous bits of progress include:
* Trying to sign up for MailChimp again but realising I had already used the single &ldquo;audience&rdquo; for a test page I launched (startyourown.co) and then abandoned, so signing up for ConvertKit instead. Both are companies firmly in the marketing world that I consider at least slightly email (tracking, targeted advertising etc), but I do not want to sink the time needed into building my own mailing list system at this stag.
* Having the deck I mentioned in the previous post designed on fiverr - I wasn&rsquo;t super excited about the result but it&rsquo;s not terrible either and was good enough for what I needed it for. You can see it <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uFljO1odpS9oyaTHY0uA4wO63WX_r_H6buEulXJzYPY/">here</a>
* Telling various people about Ritza and getting feedback. I did a mini-pitch and discussion for Ritza to two informal meetup groups, both through ZATech, and got some positive feedback on the concept (yay!) and some advice.
* I started a &ldquo;Zettelkasten&rdquo; system based on the advice of <a href="https://cpbotha.net/">CP Botha</a>. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out exactly to best use it and I am currently maintaining both a physical version with pen and paper and a digital version (I think the double entry actually helps instil the notes mentally too, but I only have 12 or so thus far so we&rsquo;ll see).</p>

<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>

<p>In the previous post, I mentioned I was on track to make $6000 in revenue for April. I ended up invoicing $5600 in revenue in the end after having to end a relationship with one client.</p>

<p>I had already agreed to something significantly below my usual rate for a trial article to &ldquo;build the relationship&rdquo; and had a good call with the CEO of the company to discuss the goals for the piece. Things seemed fairly promising until I submitted a 100 word or so outline as requested (basically just headings and a short description of what would be in each) and got dozens of nitpicky comments in response &ndash; their editor spent over 2 hours (based on the Google docs comments timestamps) making comments about style, capitalization, American spelling conventions, etc etc. Maybe she was just very thorough but I took it badly and it felt like the comments were coming from an egotistical place rather than a supportive one, so I decided that it wasn&rsquo;t worth the time or emotional energy.</p>

<h2 id="what-got-published">What got published</h2>

<ul>
<li>I spent many hours on editing a Python data science tutorial which had some pretty obscure and frustrating bugs and took way longer to fix than I had estimated.</li>
<li>I also wrote <a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog/machine-learning-for-managers">Machine learning for managers</a>, which again hit rank #1 on Google after 48 hours for the search term <code>Machine Learning for Managers</code> and is now hovering between #1 and #3 for me.</li>
<li>I compiled my first <a href="https://ritza.co/showcase/repl.it">showcase</a>. This involved downloading the original sources, cleaning up some of the markdown, finding a pandoc workflow that works for me (at the moment it&rsquo;s markdown -&gt; <code>.adoc</code> (asciidoctor) using pandoc and then .adoc -&gt; html using asciidoctor and the Ruby CSS stylesheet with highlight.js and the Monokai theme (which seems to be the only one that highlights a decent number of Python keywords). Once I have a publication pipeline better put together I&rsquo;ll publish a separate article on that. I also am editing the collection into a book format (currently downloadable as an ebook from the showcase page, but I&rsquo;m adding an introduction, removing external links, and linking the chapters together more cohesively still).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-next">Where next?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to get the legal and tax side of everything set up. Progress is frustratingly slow. I also have a todo list which currently contains things such as
* Collecting the rest of my content from around the web to combine it into more &ldquo;showcases&rdquo;
* Extending the homepage and additional pages to answer more questions people have (what kind of content do you produce?, why is it so expensive?, is this marketing?, why should I buy this? are some at the moment)
* Adding an &ldquo;/open&rdquo; dashboard (I was going to link to the popular Baremetrics page here but then I discovered that they link to &ldquo;Hubstaff&rdquo; which provides malware to allow employers to spy on their employees so I won&rsquo;t)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect things to change too much in the next 4 weeks while I am still spending a majority of my time at my full time job, but I hope to set more ambitious monthly goals from 1 June!</p>
