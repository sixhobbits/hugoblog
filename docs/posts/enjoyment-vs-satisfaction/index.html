  <div class="post-content"><p>The English language is not known for being precise. People use the same words to mean very different things, often inconsistently. This confused language leads to confused thoughts, which leads people to make bad decisions.</p>

<p>One example of this is are two different pleasurable feelings, which I&rsquo;ll call <em>enjoyment</em> and <em>satisfaction</em>, although most people use these fairly interchangeably. For now, let&rsquo;s assume that enjoyment is a short-lived shallower emotion, while satisfaction lasts longer and is overall more desirable (another word with an imprecise meaning).</p>

<p>People say things like, &ldquo;I really enjoy pizza&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I really enjoy writing&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I enjoy hiking&rdquo;, but they mean pretty different things. Although it&rsquo;s hard to generalize, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to feel a short-lived positive emotion <em>while eating</em> pizza, followed by a long-lived negative one a short time afterwards. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s more common for people to feel short-lived negative emotions while writing (frustration) or hiking (exhaustion), but feel longer-lived positive emotions afterwards (pride, exhilaration).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say that people enjoy eating pizza and find satisfaction by hiking up mountains (everyone is different, so choose your own examples that make more sense if necessary).</p>

<p>We often conflate these meanings, and that&rsquo;s strange because in a way they&rsquo;re opposites. And because we conflate the meanings, we make bad decisions. We order pizza when we&rsquo;re sad because through imprecise language we have come to associate the concept of pizza with the emotion that we experience after hiking.</p>

<p>I chose the term <em>satisfaction</em>, because this is another concept that we often understand poorly. We experience desire or need for satisfaction, and we try to satisfy or fulfil these desires. But again because of poor terminology, we fail to differentiate between two kinds of desire &ndash; the desire for enjoyment and the desire for satisfaction.</p>

<p>Our desires for satisfaction <em>can</em> be fulfilled. We experience the desire, we complete some action, and the desire goes away. Our desires for enjoyment <em>cannot</em> be fulfilled, but instead they grow into habits as we feed them. If you try to satisfy your desire to eat pizza by eating pizza, the desire will grow more frequent.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite hard to differentiate between desires that can be fulfilled through action, and those that grow stronger when you attempt to fulfil them, but it&rsquo;s pretty important to try and make this distinction as accurately as possible. There are also desires that fall in grey areas between enjoyment and satisfaction. For example, people who have a running habit might not enjoy running, but the runner&rsquo;s rush is enough to keep them at it. Therefore, running can be like enjoyment (it&rsquo;s a desire where the attempted fulfilment grows the desire into a habit), but also like satisfaction (it&rsquo;s unenjoyable while you do it, but satisfying after).</p>

<p>Before you try fulfil a desire, try to classify into enjoyment or satisfaction first. Some, like &ldquo;retail therapy&rdquo; are obvious, and should be avoided, but they are engrained enough into society, with the help of marketing manipulation, that people don&rsquo;t really notice.</p>

  <p><i><b>Note:</b>This post is part of my <a href="#">Publish Daily</a> goal. These posts are written quickly (sometimes before coffee) and not edited. I often battle to write exactly what I mean (or think I mean) the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice. If I don't publish the snippets, I won't care as much about the quality, so the main reason for publishing is to force myself to care. I also hope that they may be interesting to at least one person out there though.</i></p>
