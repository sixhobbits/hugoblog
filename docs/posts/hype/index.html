            <p>People like hype. Hype is hard to identify when it&rsquo;s happening, and is easy to identify with hindsight. Hype can last for different amounts of time - anything from minutes to decades.</p>
<p>Hype in the world of technology is bad. A recurring theme is people getting very excited about some new technology and spending thousands of hours learning about it, building programmes or even whole schools around it, and over-saturating the market without producing much value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> has become something of a meme, and is fairly useful to talking about how hyped any new technology is. But like most business charts, it&rsquo;s hugely over-simplified. Manager-types love reducing any problem to a single graph and trying to sound smart by claiming to have solved it.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency was and is an obvious hype. There is some value in the invention, but a majority of people were not using it for anything that made it a better solution than previous technology. &ldquo;Big data&rdquo; continues to be relevant, but also did not live up to the hype from around 2014.</p>
<p>Deep learning, Machine learning, AI, Data Science are reaching peak hype.</p>
<p>A good way to identify hype is to divide things into <em>problems</em> and <em>solutions</em>. When people are focussing more on solutions than problems, it&rsquo;s likely that the solution is hyped.</p>
<p>For example, companies setting up &ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; teams or &ldquo;big data&rdquo; teams organises people around implementing a solution instead of solving problems. They get the latest and greatest algorithms and some highly paid people, and <em>then</em> ask &ldquo;what can technology $x$ do for us&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Sometimes, hype can also be identified by seeing new terminology be invented for old solutions. For example, we&rsquo;ve always had data analysts and statisticians. These people were widely regarded as stereotypically boring, along with accountants (any readers excluded of course). Now a lot of what these people do has been rebranded as &ldquo;data science&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. AI had a very specific meaning until recently. It was a branch of computer science concerned with path finding algorithms and optimisation problems. Now that we spread the term around liberally, in nearly any case where a computer is being used to solve a problem, terminology has gotten a lot less precise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Powers That Be have decided that &ldquo;Data Scientist&rdquo; is the sexiest job of the year. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since Chandler Bing from <em>Friends</em> was given a data analyst job as an example of the pinnacle of boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard sometimes not to get caught up in the hype. Sometimes it&rsquo;s real. Some &ldquo;AI&rdquo; really did change the world, and some of it continues to do so. Big data has also changed how surveillance and marketing work, but most people don&rsquo;t like talking about that as much now as when people claimed that it would cure cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to keep up with the hype and stay informed, but to spend a majority of your time learning about old knowledge rather. Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a> it&rsquo;s far more likely that something that has been relevant for the last 50 years will remain relevant for the next 50 years than something that was only invented yesterday.</p>
