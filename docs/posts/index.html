  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">2018: Retrospective This is a (late) 2018 retrospective. It‚Äôs mainly for personal use as I enjoy looking back and seeing how naive I was $n$ years ago, but I‚Äôve enjoyed reading retrospectives from others in the tech community so I‚Äôm making it public without advertising it too widely.
The year of employment I took up full time employment at CoGrammar (formerly HyperionDev, a product we still run) in November 2017....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Inconsistent Ethics and Voting</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that many people partially rely on. It‚Äôs the simplest form of ethics: if you want to know if some action is moral or not, just have a look at the result of that action, and then decide.
Should you give food to a starving person? Sure, it will result in the starving person not being hungry, which is a moral result, so therefore the charity is a moral action....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Incentives seem very well understood. We have a whole bunch of natural sounding ideas, such as
 If you reward a person for a specific behaviour, you‚Äôll encourage more of that behaviour. If you punish someone for a specific behaviour, you‚Äôll encourage less of that behaviour. If you need someone to do something that they don‚Äôt want to do, you need to monitor them to make sure that they actually do it....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Salaries After the big #TalkPay movement a couple of years ago, and the related discussion that came up as a result, I thought people were more aware of the imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to salary negotiation. But I still see a lot of people who are very happy to answer this question straight up. You shouldn‚Äôt. Never name the first number in a salary negotiation, and never give up any information about your previous salaries either....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Boredom</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">People are afraid of boredom. They actively avoid having any time that is unscheduled. If they do find a brief moment of unscheduled time, they quickly focus on finding something to do (reading Twitter in the checkout queue).
Boredom isn‚Äôt really a negative emotion. It‚Äôs not like fear or dread or hate or pain. And even busy-bodies like it for brief moments, as long as you call it ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù.
You get home from whatever chaotic thing seemed important at the time, and just do nothing for a while....</p>

(their highlight).
If you‚Äôve read any Dale Carnegie or other pop-psychology of a ‚Äúself help‚Äù kind of nature, the first advice you usually hear about getting other people to do things for you. These people will tell you to make sure you focus not on yourself but on the other person....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Technical Interviews</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Many programmers don‚Äôt like the style of technical interviews given by most companies. In these ‚Äúwhiteboarding‚Äù interviews, you are usually given a difficult problem from computer science in which you have to produce a program that can take some input and efficiently produce some related output. Usually, to pass these interviews, you need to have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, including graph traversal algorithms, tree data structures (maybe even the dreaded red-black tree, which is known for being very complicated and hard to understand intuitively), and dynamic programming....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">People like hype. Hype is hard to identify when it‚Äôs happening, and is easy to identify with hindsight. Hype can last for different amounts of time - anything from minutes to decades.
Hype in the world of technology is bad. A recurring theme is people getting very excited about some new technology and spending thousands of hours learning about it, building programmes or even whole schools around it, and over-saturating the market without producing much value....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Risk Calculation and Human Biases</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Most days that you live through, you do some kind of risk calculations. We‚Äôre seldom certain about anything, so we learn to estimate probabilities based on a wide range of knowledge and experiences, and hope for the best.
Most of us humans get pretty good at this, and we use this risk calculation skill to stay alive, pursue happiness, make money, and help other people.
We also have a bunch of annoying biases though, and these biases often lead us to make the wrong choices....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Enjoyment vs Satisfaction</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">The English language is not known for being precise. People use the same words to mean very different things, often inconsistently. This confused language leads to confused thoughts, which leads people to make bad decisions.
One example of this is are two different pleasurable feelings, which I‚Äôll call enjoyment and satisfaction, although most people use these fairly interchangeably. For now, let‚Äôs assume that enjoyment is a short-lived shallower emotion, while satisfaction lasts longer and is overall more desirable (another word with an imprecise meaning)....</p>
