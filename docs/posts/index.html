  Someone, probably  The quote above gets thrown around a lot in my circles, but I think it is useful in several ways. Most people are too concerned with short term value, too ambitious with their short term goals, and unwilling to stick at something for very long. This bias leads companies to focus too heavily on monthly or quarterly (or weekly!...</p>

If you are lucky enough to work with a small group of intelligent people, dedicated to a single cause, process is probably hurting them more than helping them. You should remove it. Nearly all....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Pieter Levels, the guy behind NomadList and RemoteOK, and bunch of other interesting ideas wrote a short post earlier today about the future of building applications without code. It is at https://levels.io/no-code/.
I agree with most of the ideas, including - It‚Äôs getting easier to build applications that can solve complex problems and generate value, without writing code - More companies will do this over time - We‚Äôre still far off from finding a more efficient way to build complicated applications than ‚Äòmanually‚Äô stiching if statement and while loops together....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Most people who are successful acknowledge the role that luck plays. Some people don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm going to assume that there is some element of luck - 100 businesses may be nearly identical in all aspects generally regarded to be likely to affect the success of the business. One of them might do very well for no easily discernable reason, while the others fall into obscurity or disappear altogether.
The one who is successful will probably write a story telling the world how they achieved success....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A self-refuting statement is a statement that logically proves itself false. Philosophers and logicians have been arguing about exactly what this means for years.
For now, I‚Äôm going work from a broader definition of a statement that‚Äôs mere existence makes the reader immediately assume that the opposite is true. For example, ‚ÄúThis is not a pyramid scheme‚Äù is a phrase usually only used during the attempt to get someone to buy into a pyramid scheme (or now, more often in comedy too)....</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Paradoxes in Marketing</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Sometimes, aiming at a goal is the best way to ensure that you hit that goal. At other times, the relationship is more subtle (for example, what you think might be goal, could actualy be a measurement).
In many cases, aiming at the goal, or at least what seems to be the goal, is surest way to miss the goal. Take, for example, the fairly modern fad of ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù. The basic idea is that ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù are valuable ‚Äì you don‚Äôt know exactly which of your connections will help you in what way or at what time, but it is very common for somone that you know to provide you with value....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Many people have problems without solution. This can be frustrating for those people.
It‚Äôs more and more common for people to have solutions without problems, which can also be frustrating for those people, and for those around them.
Especially in over-hyped spaces, such as big data, blockchain, deep learning, data science, and the internet of things, people look for problems that they can solve. This is almost always misguided.
People who want to ‚Äúdo data science‚Äù usually don‚Äôt....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
&gt; Charles Goodhart
 Measuring stuff is generally useful. Data, in general, is useful too. If you‚Äôre trying to run a big complicated business, it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to look at data, see what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and make decisions accordingly.
But.
Measurements should never be goals. Ever. Maybe the number of lines of code your programmers are writing is in some way linked to their value as a programmer, but paying or promoting them based on LoC is an obviously terrible idea....</p>
