      <description>May 2020 was my last month trying to launch Ritza while being full time employed. My last month (hopefully ever!) as a full time employee was fairly busy with handovers and whatnot and this definitely impacted progress on Ritza, so I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to being able to stop splitting focus (spoiler for next month&amp;rsquo;s retro, the first week has been pretty great!).

      <description>I did a 2020 Q1 retrospective pretty late, so this is more focused on the 10-30 April period.
Ritza progress Ritza is still evolving at what feels like a slow pace. I launched ritza.co today (actually it has been live for a while, but it had a brain dump on the homepage which I rewrote today to have more structure and provide more relevant information). I shared it on ZATech, HackerNews, and the EUTech telegram group and got some good feedback (thank you if you were one of the people that provided this!</description>

  Someone, probably  The quote above gets thrown around a lot in my circles, but I think it is useful in several ways. Most people are too concerned with short term value, too ambitious with their short term goals, and unwilling to stick at something for very long.

      <description>Process is designed to make systems more efficient, but it often slows them down. The real purpose of process is to make systems, and especially employees, more fungible.
If you are lucky enough to work with a small group of intelligent people, dedicated to a single cause, process is probably hurting them more than helping them. You should remove it. Nearly all.</description>

      <description>Pieter Levels, the guy behind NomadList and RemoteOK, and bunch of other interesting ideas wrote a short post earlier today about the future of building applications without code. It is at https://levels.io/no-code/.
I agree with most of the ideas, including - It&amp;rsquo;s getting easier to build applications that can solve complex problems and generate value, without writing code - More companies will do this over time - We&amp;rsquo;re still far off from finding a more efficient way to build complicated applications than &amp;lsquo;manually&amp;rsquo; stiching if statement and while loops together.</description>

      <description>Most people who are successful acknowledge the role that luck plays. Some people don&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that there is some element of luck - 100 businesses may be nearly identical in all aspects generally regarded to be likely to affect the success of the business. One of them might do very well for no easily discernable reason, while the others fall into obscurity or disappear altogether.
The one who is successful will probably write a story telling the world how they achieved success.</description>

      <guid>https://sixhobbits.github.io/hugoblog/posts/overcoming-self-refuting-statements/</guid>
      <description>A self-refuting statement is a statement that logically proves itself false. Philosophers and logicians have been arguing about exactly what this means for years.
For now, I&amp;rsquo;m going work from a broader definition of a statement that&amp;rsquo;s mere existence makes the reader immediately assume that the opposite is true. For example, &amp;ldquo;This is not a pyramid scheme&amp;rdquo; is a phrase usually only used during the attempt to get someone to buy into a pyramid scheme (or now, more often in comedy too).</description>

      <description>Sometimes I disagree with people about things. Sometimes I am right, sometimes I am wrong, and sometimes the disagreement is about something that cannot be proven either way for many years.
This is a list of some of those things, for the record and for fun.
Remote working Remote working will become far more normal in most industries. Currently, people are flocking to cities and hubs in unsustainable ways. They pay a huge amount of rent for a tiny apartment, and leave it empty most of the day.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, aiming at a goal is the best way to ensure that you hit that goal. At other times, the relationship is more subtle (for example, what you think might be goal, could actualy be a measurement).
In many cases, aiming at the goal, or at least what seems to be the goal, is surest way to miss the goal. Take, for example, the fairly modern fad of &amp;ldquo;networking&amp;rdquo;. The basic idea is that &amp;ldquo;networks&amp;rdquo; are valuable &amp;ndash; you don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly which of your connections will help you in what way or at what time, but it is very common for somone that you know to provide you with value.</description>

      <description>Many people have problems without solution. This can be frustrating for those people.
It&amp;rsquo;s more and more common for people to have solutions without problems, which can also be frustrating for those people, and for those around them.
Especially in over-hyped spaces, such as big data, blockchain, deep learning, data science, and the internet of things, people look for problems that they can solve. This is almost always misguided.
People who want to &amp;ldquo;do data science&amp;rdquo; usually don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
&amp;gt; Charles Goodhart
 Measuring stuff is generally useful. Data, in general, is useful too. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to run a big complicated business, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a good idea to look at data, see what works, what doesn&amp;rsquo;t, and make decisions accordingly.
But.
Measurements should never be goals. Ever. Maybe the number of lines of code your programmers are writing is in some way linked to their value as a programmer, but paying or promoting them based on LoC is an obviously terrible idea.</description>

      <description>There is no shortage of people, agencies, books, and videos out there that will teach you how to game Google&amp;rsquo;s algorithms and get your content onto page one. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to &amp;ldquo;rank for specific keywords&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;optimise your content strategy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;increase your domain authority&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;get 5000% returns, GUARANTEED from this AMAZING course FREE FOR TODAY ONLY!!!&amp;rdquo;.
Search Engine Optimisation or SEO isn&amp;rsquo;t all bullshit, but the ratio of bullshit to reasonable ideas is around 9:1 in my experience.</description>

To (probably) misquote Douglas Adams:
 Asking people about their opinions is a great way of making friends. Telling people about your opinions can also work, but normally not quite as well.
 And he definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t wrong. Similar to opinions, asking people for advice is a good way of making friends too. Giving people unrequested advice is a good way to annoy them.</description>

      <description>This is a (late) 2018 retrospective. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for personal use as I enjoy looking back and seeing how naive I was $n$ years ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading retrospectives from others in the tech community so I&amp;rsquo;m making it public without advertising it too widely.
The year of employment I took up full time employment at CoGrammar (formerly HyperionDev, a product we still run) in November 2017. As I&amp;rsquo;m still here, 2018 marks my first year ever of uninterrupted full time employment (I previously did two relatively long periods at AWS, but these were interleved between academic commitments).</description>

      <description>Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that many people partially rely on. It&amp;rsquo;s the simplest form of ethics: if you want to know if some action is moral or not, just have a look at the result of that action, and then decide.
Should you give food to a starving person? Sure, it will result in the starving person not being hungry, which is a moral result, so therefore the charity is a moral action.</description>

      <description>Incentives seem very well understood. We have a whole bunch of natural sounding ideas, such as
 If you reward a person for a specific behaviour, you&amp;rsquo;ll encourage more of that behaviour. If you punish someone for a specific behaviour, you&amp;rsquo;ll encourage less of that behaviour. If you need someone to do something that they don&amp;rsquo;t want to do, you need to monitor them to make sure that they actually do it.</description>

      <description>Salaries After the big #TalkPay movement a couple of years ago, and the related discussion that came up as a result, I thought people were more aware of the imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to salary negotiation. But I still see a lot of people who are very happy to answer this question straight up. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Never name the first number in a salary negotiation, and never give up any information about your previous salaries either.</description>

      <description>People are afraid of boredom. They actively avoid having any time that is unscheduled. If they do find a brief moment of unscheduled time, they quickly focus on finding something to do (reading Twitter in the checkout queue).
Boredom isn&amp;rsquo;t really a negative emotion. It&amp;rsquo;s not like fear or dread or hate or pain. And even busy-bodies like it for brief moments, as long as you call it &amp;ldquo;relaxation&amp;rdquo;.
You get home from whatever chaotic thing seemed important at the time, and just do nothing for a while.</description>

(their highlight).
If you&amp;rsquo;ve read any Dale Carnegie or other pop-psychology of a &amp;ldquo;self help&amp;rdquo; kind of nature, the first advice you usually hear about getting other people to do things for you. These people will tell you to make sure you focus not on yourself but on the other person.</description>

      <description>Many programmers don&amp;rsquo;t like the style of technical interviews given by most companies. In these &amp;ldquo;whiteboarding&amp;rdquo; interviews, you are usually given a difficult problem from computer science in which you have to produce a program that can take some input and efficiently produce some related output. Usually, to pass these interviews, you need to have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, including graph traversal algorithms, tree data structures (maybe even the dreaded red-black tree, which is known for being very complicated and hard to understand intuitively), and dynamic programming.</description>

      <description>People like hype. Hype is hard to identify when it&amp;rsquo;s happening, and is easy to identify with hindsight. Hype can last for different amounts of time - anything from minutes to decades.
Hype in the world of technology is bad. A recurring theme is people getting very excited about some new technology and spending thousands of hours learning about it, building programmes or even whole schools around it, and over-saturating the market without producing much value.</description>

      <description>Most days that you live through, you do some kind of risk calculations. We&amp;rsquo;re seldom certain about anything, so we learn to estimate probabilities based on a wide range of knowledge and experiences, and hope for the best.
Most of us humans get pretty good at this, and we use this risk calculation skill to stay alive, pursue happiness, make money, and help other people.
We also have a bunch of annoying biases though, and these biases often lead us to make the wrong choices.</description>

      <description>The English language is not known for being precise. People use the same words to mean very different things, often inconsistently. This confused language leads to confused thoughts, which leads people to make bad decisions.
One example of this is are two different pleasurable feelings, which I&amp;rsquo;ll call enjoyment and satisfaction, although most people use these fairly interchangeably. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that enjoyment is a short-lived shallower emotion, while satisfaction lasts longer and is overall more desirable (another word with an imprecise meaning).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful&amp;rdquo;, someone smart once said.
A common mistake people make is to have mental models in too few dimensions. This is understandable because thinking in multiple dimensions is a known human weakness. If you want to visualise something in 17 dimensional space, you have to visualise it in 3 dimensional space and say &amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo; to yourself repeatedly.
But I digress. Take introverts for example.</description>

Children get introduced to the idea that someone else should tell you what to do and when to do it at a young age, but it is far from a natural or healthy way to live.</description>

      <description>People will tell you to fake it until you make it. You might find that slightly disturbing. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the world have enough lying, over-confident people in it already? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably met that guy (let&amp;rsquo;s call him Guy) who says he can do everything, but can&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe people think he&amp;rsquo;s smart, but actually it&amp;rsquo;s all just a veneer of confidence, and as he walks through life causing trouble and producing bad quality output, he continues to cover everything in his oily confidence, and people continue to regard him as competent.</description>

I fell in and out of several good and bad habits during 2018, including a reading habit where I read a bunch of books, a note-taking habit where I took copious notes about each of these books, and a writing habit, where I worked each morning for an hour on writing technical tutorials, emails, or other ideas.</description>
