<p>Machine Learning and AI will fall out of the public eye, but continue to be used extensively in products like self-driving cars and natural language processing. People will regard these as normal and care less about what what &ldquo;AI&rdquo; actually means. Research will be done once again mainly in statistics departments   rather than in <em>Data Science</em> departments. The term &ldquo;Data Science&rdquo; will fall out of the general public&rsquo;s day-to-day usage, but will continue to be referred to similarly to how &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; are talked about today.</p>

<h2 id="2025">2025</h2>

<p>Nearly all large companies employ a significant percentage of their staff in fully remote positions from around the world. The distinction of &ldquo;remote only&rdquo;, &ldquo;fully remote&rdquo;, &ldquo;remote friendly&rdquo;, or &ldquo;onsite only&rdquo; becomes more like the difference between a company deciding to provide free coffee or not.</p>

  <p><i><b>Note:</b>This post is part of my <a href="#">Publish Daily</a> goal. These posts are written quickly (sometimes before coffee) and not edited. I often battle to write exactly what I mean (or think I mean) the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice. If I don't publish the snippets, I won't care as much about the quality, so the main reason for publishing is to force myself to care. I also hope that they may be interesting to at least one person out there though.</i></p>
