  <div class="post-content"><p>People are afraid of boredom. They actively avoid having any time that is unscheduled. If they do find a brief moment of unscheduled time, they quickly focus on finding something to do (reading Twitter in the checkout queue).</p>

<p>Boredom isn&rsquo;t really a negative emotion. It&rsquo;s not like fear or dread or hate or pain. And even busy-bodies like it for brief moments, as long as you call it &ldquo;relaxation&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You get home from whatever chaotic thing seemed important at the time, and just do nothing for a while. It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s what you wanted. And then you&rsquo;re bored, and you turn on Netflix or argue about politics.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t actually dislike boredom. Mainly they&rsquo;re just worried that boredom will lead to more negative emotions.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lbIuWZX.jpg" alt="Image result for existential dread" /></p>

<p>And often it does. The unchecked mind with no explicit focus wanders off, and doesn&rsquo;t always end up in the most positive of places.</p>

<p>But boredom is still useful. If you have any overall, vague goals in life, boredom is one of the best ways of achieving them (or at least working out how to).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve hung around in offices or made friends with Managerial types at all, you&rsquo;ve probably heard someone harp on about the &ldquo;urgent/important&rdquo; quadrant, which looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.developgoodhabits.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/How-to-Make-Decisions-on-What%E2%80%99s-Urgent-and-Important-min.jpg" alt="Image result for urgent important" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s oversimplified, but urgent means that the task needs to be done now, and important means that the task needs to be done at some (often unspecified) point in the future.</p>

<p>Stuff that is urgent always gets done before stuff that&rsquo;s important, and it&rsquo;s easy to let long-term important things fail, just because they never seemed urgent (e.g. finding time to sleep properly and not sitting all day &ndash; these things are not urgent, because you could always do them tomorrow rather, but they&rsquo;re important because you have to do them at some point or deal with rather unpleasant consequences).</p>

<p>Boredom is a great stage to work on the important <em>not-urgent</em> things. It takes some practice though, as even if you learn to not reach for your phone at the first sign of boredom, it&rsquo;s likely that your next go-to will be some kind of stressful emotion about something that&rsquo;s urgent.</p>

<p>A good place to find boredom is classical music concerts. They&rsquo;re at least 90 minutes long, and have enough old, respectful people to make you feel bad for looking at your phone. After studying classical music for many years and never managing to not be bored during concerts, I&rsquo;m still not brave enough to ask real musicians if they also get bored during concerts. I suspect that they do.</p>

  <p><i><b>Note:</b>This post is part of my <a href="#">Publish Daily</a> goal. These posts are written quickly (sometimes before coffee) and not edited. I often battle to write exactly what I mean (or think I mean) the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice. If I don't publish the snippets, I won't care as much about the quality, so the main reason for publishing is to force myself to care. I also hope that they may be interesting to at least one person out there though.</i></p>
