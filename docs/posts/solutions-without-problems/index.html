<p>It&rsquo;s more and more common for people to have solutions without problems, which can also be frustrating for those people, and for those around them.</p>

<p>Especially in over-hyped spaces, such as big data, blockchain, deep learning, data science, and the internet of things, people look for problems that they can solve. This is almost always misguided.</p>

<p>People who want to &ldquo;do data science&rdquo; usually don&rsquo;t. That is, they usually both don&rsquo;t actually <em>want</em> to do data science, once they realise what it is, and they usually don&rsquo;t <em>do</em> data science while they are working out what it is.</p>

<p>If you are going to spend hours of your life cleaning and understanding a data set, you usually have to either a) be getting paid a lot of money, or b) care deeply about the problem that you are analysing. The problem could be many things, from how to optimize a sales process, to how quickly the environment is being destroyed, but the problem <em>definitely isn&rsquo;t</em> that no one was &ldquo;doing data science&rdquo; before, and now someone is.</p>

<p>People often say to me things like &ldquo;I want to learn Django - what is a good way of doing this?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s usually easiest to learn $thing when you have a problem and $thing is a solution. It&rsquo;s more difficult to learn $thing, when $thing is designed to solve a problem that you don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Teachers make this mistake too. They tell their students to learn webpack, or bootstrap, or Object Oriented Programming, or databases. And they show their students how these solutions work. But often they don&rsquo;t make sure that their students understand the problems that these solutions aim to solve.</p>

<p>The best way to understand a problem is to encounter it. It is possible to understand a problem in a more theoretical way, by talking to someone who encountered the problem, or talking to someone who spoke to someone who encountered the problem, but the further removed you are from experiencing a problem first hand, the more difficult it is to understand the subtleties or to see the need for the solution.</p>

<p>Look for solutions to problems you have, rather than problems for the solutions you have.</p>

  <p><i><b>Note:</b>This post is part of my <a href="#">Publish Daily</a> goal. These posts are written quickly (sometimes before coffee) and not edited. I often battle to write exactly what I mean (or think I mean) the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice. If I don't publish the snippets, I won't care as much about the quality, so the main reason for publishing is to force myself to care. I also hope that they may be interesting to at least one person out there though.</i></p>
