  <div class="post-content"><p>There is no shortage of people, agencies, books, and videos out there that will teach you how to game Google&rsquo;s algorithms and get your content onto page one. You&rsquo;ll learn how to &ldquo;rank for specific keywords&rdquo;, &ldquo;optimise your content strategy&rdquo;, &ldquo;increase your domain authority&rdquo;, and &ldquo;get 5000% returns, GUARANTEED from this AMAZING course FREE FOR TODAY ONLY!!!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimisation or SEO isn&rsquo;t all bullshit, but the ratio of bullshit to reasonable ideas is around 9:1 in my experience. And the 10% of content that is authentically attempting to help people through education is largely common sense - write content that people want to read, make sure your page loads fast and all devices, use sane page structures that Google can easily understand.</p>

<p>A strategy that works remarkable well but which most people won&rsquo;t tell you about, because it&rsquo;s difficult to charge money for, is to leave search engine optimization to search engines.</p>

<p>Google spends unthinkable amounts of money in trying to make their main product — Google search — as useful as possible. They are attempting to optimize their search engine to show people relevant content. And they&rsquo;re pretty good at it. Trying to optimize your content for search engines is certainly possible, but it&rsquo;s an ever-changing game which takes a lot of time, effort, and money.</p>

<p>If you have a choice between spending $10k of your hard-earned and 100 hours of your increasingly rare time on drawing visitors to your website, you have to divide it among the following areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing content that people want to read or finding and paying good content writers who write content that people want to read</li>
<li>&ldquo;Strategizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brainstorming&rdquo; about topic ideas</li>
<li>Buying SEO software</li>
<li>Paying SEO specialists to do any of the above</li>
<li>Paying software developers to optimize the speed of your site through caching, CDNs, deferred JavaScript and any other number of tricks</li>
<li>Buying training courses and books for yourself and your team</li>
<li>Doing ritualistic animal sacrifices to the SEO Gods</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ol>

<p>All of them are likely to help in some way, and you can combine in anyway that you think will work for you,  but focussing only on <em>1.</em> has a few advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage one</strong>: It&rsquo;s not complicated. Write content that <em>educates</em> your potential customers for free, and they&rsquo;ll love it. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about which SEO methods really work and which are snake oil. You don&rsquo;t have to ask if the software is really worth that insane monthly price tag. You don&rsquo;t have to wonder if that Expert is really Expert or if he is in fact a Non-Expert-Pretending-To-Be-An-Expert.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage two</strong>: You leave SEO to Google, who are definitely fairly good at it. They&rsquo;ll make sure that changes to their algorithms still return content like yours, instead of vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Advantage three:</strong> You&rsquo;ll be making the internet, and therefore the world, a better place by creating content that people want to read instead of creating yet another clickbait piece that somehow generates a small amount of money for you for a short time and a huge amount of money for Google when combined with all the other similar content.</p>

<p>Sometimes the easy way out is the best. Write good content that helps solve real problems that people have and Google will help people find it.</p>

I often battle to write exactly what I mean (or think I mean) the first time, so they may not reflect what I believe. My overall goal is to be able to write publishable prose with minimal editing in a short space of time and I believe that this is only possible through practice.</i></p>
