            <p>Many programmers don&rsquo;t like the style of technical interviews given by most companies. In these &ldquo;whiteboarding&rdquo; interviews, you are usually given a difficult problem from computer science in which you have to produce a program that can take some input and efficiently produce some related output. Usually, to pass these interviews, you need to have a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, including graph traversal algorithms, tree data structures (maybe even the dreaded red-black tree, which is known for being very complicated and hard to understand intuitively),  and dynamic programming.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like them because although these topics are usually taught at university computer science courses, very few people use any of that knowledge day-to-day. All of these &ldquo;classic&rdquo; problems have libraries that are far more efficient than the simplified algorithms taught in theory classes, and to do well at these questions, you usually need to memorise a whole bunch of &ldquo;useless&rdquo; knowledge (knowledge that you don&rsquo;t need outside of a context where you are being evaluated).</p>
<p>There are some reason why technical interviewing hasn&rsquo;t changed much in spite of the problems that people raise though.</p>
<h4 id="most-companies-prefer-false-negatives-to-false-positives">Most companies prefer false negatives to false positives</h4>
<p>An interview tries to classify candidates into &ldquo;hire&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hire&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s usually better for companies to have a good candidate go into the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hire&rdquo; pool than vice-versa. It&rsquo;s far more costly to hire a &ldquo;bad egg&rdquo;, who can take a long time to get rid of, and cause damage, than it is to miss a &ldquo;good egg&rdquo; (there will always be more good eggs in the queue). There are a lot of &ldquo;good eggs&rdquo; who do badly at programming interviews &ndash; they have more practical experience than theoretical experience, and they dislike memorising useless knowledge, but Google is happy to lose out on these. It&rsquo;s far less common for someone to be able to write out a left-rotation for a red-black tree on a white board who is then incompetent in other areas. So white boarding isn&rsquo;t directly testing the skills that companies actually want, but given their preferences of not hiring bad eggs, it&rsquo;s a decent proxy.</p>
<h4 id="companies-value-predictability-and-loyalty">Companies value predictability and loyalty</h4>
<p>People who do well at whiteboarding are often similar in other ways too. They are good problem solvers (you can&rsquo;t memorise every possible interview question, so while memorisation helps, you still need to be able to apply the concepts you memorised in slightly novel ways), and they&rsquo;re pretty dedicated. They took the time and effort to get good at something that they knew they needed to be good at if they wanted to get hired. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to study for 3-6 months to get past a technical interview at one of the large tech companies, and there&rsquo;s enough information out here about what each company focuses on. If a candidate has taken the time and effort to work out how to do well at the interview, they probably really want to work for that specific company, which is a &ldquo;green flag&rdquo; for interviewers &ndash; they didn&rsquo;t just apply for the job as an afterthought one day. They really want it, and they&rsquo;ll probably stick around.</p>
<h4 id="there-arent-that-many-great-alternatives">There aren&rsquo;t that many great alternatives</h4>
<p>To really test someone, you need longer than a day to get to know them. The best interview would be bringing them into your existing team and to evaluate them over several weeks or months. It&rsquo;s not unusual for startups to do this &ndash; they often employ someone on a fixed-term short contract first and then convert them to full time employees after they&rsquo;ve proven themselves, but this is highly impractical for a majority of applicants, who might have full time jobs somewhere else, or need to relocate across the world to join the company that gives them a job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interviewing later today to be a part time technical interviewer for <a href="karat.io">karat.io</a> (it&rsquo;s a bit meta). They claim to solve some of these problems, but even after several years of academic computer science and several years of industry experience, I&rsquo;m only about 40% sure that I can pass their technical interview.</p>
