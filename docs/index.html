    <h2 class="post-title">Overcoming Self Refuting Statements</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">A self-refuting statement is a statement that logically proves itself false. Philosophers and logicians have been arguing about exactly what this means for years.
For now, I‚Äôm going work from a broader definition of a statement that‚Äôs mere existence makes the reader immediately assume that the opposite is true. For example, ‚ÄúThis is not a pyramid scheme‚Äù is a phrase usually only used during the attempt to get someone to buy into a pyramid scheme (or now, more often in comedy too)....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Sometimes I disagree with people about things. Sometimes I am right, sometimes I am wrong, and sometimes the disagreement is about something that cannot be proven either way for many years.
This is a list of some of those things, for the record and for fun.
Remote working Remote working will become far more normal in most industries. Currently, people are flocking to cities and hubs in unsustainable ways. They pay a huge amount of rent for a tiny apartment, and leave it empty most of the day....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Sometimes, aiming at a goal is the best way to ensure that you hit that goal. At other times, the relationship is more subtle (for example, what you think might be goal, could actualy be a measurement).
In many cases, aiming at the goal, or at least what seems to be the goal, is surest way to miss the goal. Take, for example, the fairly modern fad of ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù. The basic idea is that ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù are valuable ‚Äì you don‚Äôt know exactly which of your connections will help you in what way or at what time, but it is very common for somone that you know to provide you with value....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Many people have problems without solution. This can be frustrating for those people.
It‚Äôs more and more common for people to have solutions without problems, which can also be frustrating for those people, and for those around them.
Especially in over-hyped spaces, such as big data, blockchain, deep learning, data science, and the internet of things, people look for problems that they can solve. This is almost always misguided.
People who want to ‚Äúdo data science‚Äù usually don‚Äôt....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
&gt; Charles Goodhart
 Measuring stuff is generally useful. Data, in general, is useful too. If you‚Äôre trying to run a big complicated business, it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to look at data, see what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and make decisions accordingly.
But.
Measurements should never be goals. Ever. Maybe the number of lines of code your programmers are writing is in some way linked to their value as a programmer, but paying or promoting them based on LoC is an obviously terrible idea....</p>

To (probably) misquote Douglas Adams:
 Asking people about their opinions is a great way of making friends. Telling people about your opinions can also work, but normally not quite as well.
 And he definitely wasn‚Äôt wrong. Similar to opinions, asking people for advice is a good way of making friends too. Giving people unrequested advice is a good way to annoy them....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">This is a (late) 2018 retrospective. It‚Äôs mainly for personal use as I enjoy looking back and seeing how naive I was $n$ years ago, but I‚Äôve enjoyed reading retrospectives from others in the tech community so I‚Äôm making it public without advertising it too widely.
The year of employment I took up full time employment at CoGrammar (formerly HyperionDev, a product we still run) in November 2017. As I‚Äôm still here, 2018 marks my first year ever of uninterrupted full time employment (I previously did two relatively long periods at AWS, but these were interleved between academic commitments)....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that many people partially rely on. It‚Äôs the simplest form of ethics: if you want to know if some action is moral or not, just have a look at the result of that action, and then decide.
Should you give food to a starving person? Sure, it will result in the starving person not being hungry, which is a moral result, so therefore the charity is a moral action....</p>
