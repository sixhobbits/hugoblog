            For more background, you can find previous retrospectives for 2019, Q1 2020, April 2020, and May 2020.
In July, I founded Ritza - a technical publishing company that offers (very) technical content marketing, developer advocacy as a service, and a bunch of related publishing services. What does that mean exactly? We publish ebooks, documentation, and blog articles, usually with the goal of helping developers or technical managers in some way. For example, we did https://codewithrepl.

            May 2020 was my last month trying to launch Ritza while being full-time employed. My last month (hopefully ever!) as a full time employee was fairly busy with handovers and whatnot and this impacted progress on Ritza, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to being able to stop splitting focus (spoiler for next month&rsquo;s retro, the first week has been pretty great!).

Ritza progress Ritza is still evolving at what feels like a slow pace. I launched ritza.co today (actually it has been live for a while, but it had a brain dump on the homepage which I rewrote today to have more structure and provide more relevant information). I shared it on ZATech, HackerNews, and the EUTech telegram group and got some good feedback (thank you if you were one of the people that provided this!

Most people are too concerned with short term value, too ambitious with their short term goals, and unwilling to stick at something for very long.

            Process is designed to make systems more efficient, but it often slows them down. The real purpose of process is to make systems, and especially employees, more fungible.
If you are lucky enough to work with a small group of intelligent people, dedicated to a single cause, process is probably hurting them more than helping them. You should remove it. Nearly all.

I agree with most of the ideas, including
 It&rsquo;s getting easier to build applications that can solve complex problems and generate value, without writing code More companies will do this over time We&rsquo;re still far off from finding a more efficient way to build complicated applications than &lsquo;manually&rsquo; stiching if statement and while loops together.

            Most people who are successful acknowledge the role that luck plays. Some people don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to assume that there is some element of luck - 100 businesses may be nearly identical in all aspects generally regarded to be likely to affect the success of the business. One of them might do very well for no easily discernable reason, while the others fall into obscurity or disappear altogether.
The one who is successful will probably write a story telling the world how they achieved success.

        <div class="content post-summary">
            A self-refuting statement is a statement that logically proves itself false. Philosophers and logicians have been arguing about exactly what this means for years.
For now, I&rsquo;m going work from a broader definition of a statement that&rsquo;s mere existence makes the reader immediately assume that the opposite is true. For example, &ldquo;This is not a pyramid scheme&rdquo; is a phrase usually only used during the attempt to get someone to buy into a pyramid scheme (or now, more often in comedy too).
